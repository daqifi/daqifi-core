## Architecture at a Glance

```
DeviceSimulator (orchestrator)
├── UdpDiscoveryServer        # UDP port 30303 - discovery protocol
├── TcpDataServer              # TCP port 9760 - data connection
├── ScpiCommandProcessor       # Command parsing and execution
├── VirtualDevice              # Abstract device behavior
│   ├── Nyquist1Device        # 16-channel implementation
│   └── Nyquist3Device        # 8-channel (Phase 6)
└── SignalGenerator            # Data generation
    ├── SineWaveGenerator      # Analog signals
    └── SquareWaveGenerator    # Digital signals
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Pure C# Implementation**
   - Zero external dependencies (no Java runtime)
   - Runs anywhere .NET 8+ runs
   - Single-language codebase for maintainability

2. **Protocol Accuracy**
   - Faithful implementation of SCPI commands
   - Correct protobuf delimited format
   - Matches firmware behavior exactly

3. **Test-Friendly Architecture**
   - xUnit collection fixtures for easy usage
   - Port auto-assignment (0 = auto) to avoid conflicts
   - Deterministic signal generation
   - Fast test execution (<10 seconds for full suite)

4. **Incremental Delivery**
   - Each phase delivers working, testable code
   - No "big bang" integration
   - Early validation of approach

5. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - >80% code coverage requirement
   - Unit tests + integration tests
   - Protocol compliance validation

## Success Criteria

The simulator will be considered complete when:

- ✅ Can discover via `WiFiDeviceFinder`
- ✅ Can connect via `TcpStreamTransport`
- ✅ Can send SCPI commands and receive responses
- ✅ Can configure channels and start/stop streaming
- ✅ Receives valid protobuf streaming data at 1-1000 Hz
- ✅ All integration tests pass
- ✅ Code coverage >80%
- ✅ Zero external dependencies
- ✅ Documentation complete

## Implementation Timeline

```
Week 1: Phases 1-2 (10h)
  ├── Core infrastructure (6h)
  └── UDP discovery (4h)

Week 2: Phase 3 (8h)
  └── TCP connection & SCPI

Week 3: Phases 4-5 (14h)
  ├── Streaming implementation (8h)
  └── Testing & documentation (6h)
```

**Total**: ~3 weeks part-time or ~4 days full-time

## Research Conducted

Thorough analysis of:
- ✅ All SCPI commands in `ScpiMessageProducer.cs`
- ✅ Protobuf message structure (`DaqifiOutMessage.proto`)
- ✅ UDP discovery protocol (`WiFiDeviceFinder.cs`)
- ✅ TCP streaming protocol (delimited protobuf)
- ✅ Device capabilities (NQ1: 16ch, NQ3: 8ch)
- ✅ Existing test patterns and structure
- ✅ Java emulator implementation (validation reference)
- ✅ Firmware codebase (`daqifi-nyquist-firmware`)

## Benefits

1. **Developer Productivity**
   - Fast, local integration testing without hardware
   - Immediate feedback loop
   - No hardware setup delays

2. **CI/CD Enablement**
   - Automated integration tests in GitHub Actions
   - Regression detection before merge
   - No hardware requirements in CI

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Catch protocol breaking changes early
   - Validate edge cases and error handling
   - Third-party developer confidence

4. **Maintainability**
   - Single-language codebase (C# only)
   - Well-documented architecture
   - Clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. **Review Planning Documents**
   - Review `SIMULATOR_DESIGN.md`
   - Review `SIMULATOR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
   - Approve architecture and approach

2. **Start Implementation**
   - Begin with Phase 1 (#62)
   - Follow implementation plan code examples
   - Write tests alongside implementation

3. **Iterative Development**
   - Complete each phase fully before moving to next
   - Review and merge each phase
   - Validate against real devices periodically

4. **Future Enhancements** (Post-Phase 5)
   - Fault injection (#61 mentions Phase 6)
   - Nyquist 3 device support
   - Serial port simulation
   - Recording/playback of real device traffic

## Questions / Discussion

Before implementation begins, consider:

1. **Testing Strategy**: Should we validate simulator against real hardware before each phase merge?
2. **Performance**: Any specific performance requirements beyond "fast enough for tests"?
3. **Scope**: Any additional SCPI commands needed beyond those in implementation plan?
4. **CI Integration**: Should simulator tests run in CI from Phase 2 onwards?

## Conclusion

This planning effort provides:

- **Clear Vision**: Well-defined architecture and goals
- **Actionable Plan**: Detailed implementation steps with code examples
- **Risk Mitigation**: Incremental delivery reduces big-bang integration risk
- **Quality Focus**: Built-in testing and validation at every phase
- **Maintainability**: Comprehensive documentation for future developers

The simulator will enable hardware-independent integration testing, improve developer productivity, and increase confidence in the stability of the daqifi-core library for third-party developers.
