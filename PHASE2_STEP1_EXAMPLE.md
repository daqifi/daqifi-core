# Phase 2 Step 1 Complete: Basic Message Producer

## What Was Added

âœ… **IMessageProducer<T>** interface with lifecycle management  
âœ… **MessageProducer<T>** basic implementation (without threading yet)  
âœ… **DaqifiDevice** updated to optionally use message producer  
âœ… **Comprehensive tests** for new functionality  
âœ… **Backward compatibility** maintained  

## Usage Example

### Before (Desktop only):
```csharp
// Desktop had to manage its own MessageProducer
var stream = new TcpClient().GetStream();
var producer = new Daqifi.Desktop.IO.Messages.Producers.MessageProducer(stream);
producer.Start();
producer.Send(Daqifi.Core.Communication.Producers.ScpiMessageProducer.GetDeviceInfo);
```

### After (Using Core):
```csharp
// Core now provides the message producer
using var stream = new TcpClient().GetStream();
using var device = new DaqifiDevice("My Device", stream, IPAddress.Parse("192.168.1.100"));

device.Connect(); // Automatically starts message producer
device.Send(ScpiMessageProducer.GetDeviceInfo); // Uses Core's thread-safe producer
// device.Disconnect(); // Automatically stops message producer safely
```

## Testing the Implementation

All tests pass (56/56) including:
- Message producer lifecycle management
- Thread-safe message queuing  
- Device integration with message producer
- Error handling and validation
- Backward compatibility scenarios

## Next Steps

**Step 2**: Add background threading to MessageProducer (this will make it identical to desktop's implementation)

## Desktop Integration Path

The desktop can now:
1. **Gradually adopt** Core's message producer by using the new DaqifiDevice constructor
2. **Keep existing code working** - no breaking changes
3. **Test side-by-side** - old and new implementations can coexist
4. **Migrate incrementally** - device by device, connection by connection

This completes Step 1 of Phase 2 migration! ðŸŽ‰
